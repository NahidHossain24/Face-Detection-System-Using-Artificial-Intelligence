ABSTRACT:
The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other.
Face recognition is an identification system that uses personal characteristics of a person to
identify the person's identity. We can use several techniques to detect faces. We use Haar-
feature based cascade classifier. Haar Classifier is a supervised classifier, it has mainly been
used for facial detection but it can also be trained to detect other objects. Our aim is to use the
classifier to input data in as image and train a data set and use it in the detection program to
recognize and detect a human face. The Proposed system is based on artificial intelligent and
it is dynamic. The system is made with python and open computer vision (openCV). This
system is user friendly and can provide accurate and standard detection rate. As an output the
system is convenient to use and will further help the programmer make more useful and
convenient system.

OBJECTIVES OF APPLICATION:
(1) To design real time face detection system.
(2) To utilize the face detection system based on Haar Classifier. So that the user can
easily access and get accurate recognition of face.
(3) To develop face detection system using python ,opencv , numpy library
(4) To develop a more accurate face detection system in future
